When a person dies, one’s property (estate) may enter probate unless the decedent has participated in estate planning. What is probate? It's the name for the legal process that allocates assets according to the decedent’s [will](/docs/what-is-a-will/). Along with reconciling estate debts, this process determines how assets pass to any named heirs or beneficiaries. If there is no will, state guidelines define the allocation of the estate. The steps involved typically take from six to nine months, unless there are disputes about the will’s legality or asset distribution.

## What Is the Probate?

If a will exists, it typically names a person to serve as the administrator, or executor, of the estate. Otherwise, the court may choose an executor. Additional steps in the process include the following:

A will must be proven valid in court according to the state’s laws. For this finding, specific requirements for signatures and witnesses must be followed.

All property of the decedent must be inventoried. However, assets cannot be allocated or sold until the [probate process](/docs/how-long-is-probate-process/) has ended.

Appraisals of all property items are submitted.
Taxes and outstanding debts must be paid, including any court fees.
Once creditors are satisfied and debts are settled, the remaining property is allocated.

## Are There Any Exceptions in Property Distribution?

[To avoid probate](/docs/how-can-i-avoid-probate/) altogether, you can place assets into a living trust, which transfers ownership to the trust immediately upon signing of the document; however, you will remain in control of the property until your death. It is then up to the person designated in the trust to distribute the assets. In addition, life insurance policies and bank balances designated as “payable upon death” each go to specifically named beneficiaries of those documents.
