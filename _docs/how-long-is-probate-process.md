If a family member or close loved one has recently passed away, the stress of mourning is only exacerbated by the news that their estate will go through probate. Probate refers to the process in which a court validates the decedent’s will, or if there is none, determines the division of their estate. This is usually unwelcome news to family members who wish to move on and resolve such financial matters efficiently. If you have been informed that a loved one’s estate will be subject to the probate process, you might be asking: how long will it take?
 
## Understanding the Probate Process

There are a few important steps that must take place in order to complete the [probate process](/docs/what-is-probate/). The exact order and criteria for each differs by state, but generally speaking, you can expect to encounter each of these steps:

* Authentication of decedent’s last [will and testament](/docs/what-is-a-will/)
* Appointment of executor
* Posting of bond
* Location of assets
* Determination of valuables
* Communication with creditors
* Completion of tax returns
* Distribution of estate

All of these steps can be daunting, but with the right help you can navigate the process efficiently and effectively.

## Factors That Determine Length of Probate

Now that you understand the steps that probate entails, you are still likely wondering how long it takes. This depends on a number of different factors, including whether there is a will left by the decedent, what the overall value of the estate is, and whether the will necessitates probate negotiation at all. In some cases, probate is a formality that can be done in months. In others, it may be a contentious process lasting years. Being informed and proactive is the best way to ensure probate does not take any longer than it needs to.
