Creating a will or trust might be on your to-do list, or it might not be. It may be a more pressing concern if you are "over the hill" or experiencing health issues, but in actuality, every adult with assets should invest in an estate plan. Why? A [will](/docs/what-is-a-will/) or trust is the best way to ensure that your estate does not have to go through probate when you pass away, and it is also the most effective way to prevent any conflict regarding your assets after your death. These concerns aren’t often at the forefront of younger people’s minds, but any person who has anything of value should invest the time and energy into drafting a will or [trust](/docs/what-is-a-trust/).

## What Do Wills and Trusts Affect?

Now that you know you need a trust or will, you should consider which one you need. There are many [differences between a will and trust](/docs/difference-between-wills-trusts/), and the best option depends on a number of factors, including:

* Type of property in consideration
* Needs of beneficiaries
* When you intend to transfer assets
* Whether you want executor

## When You May Not Need a Trust

A trust is best suited to anybody who is aging or in poor health and has considerable assets to manage. If you are younger, have a median income, and do not have substantial assets, a will is likely the more practical document to plan for the unexpected. Either way, preparing for the future is a wise move, and you can customize your will to meet the unique needs of your family and loved ones. Establishing a will or trust is ultimately about providing security for potential beneficiaries, so it’s important to understand all of your options, consider the needs of your loved ones, and make an informed decision.
