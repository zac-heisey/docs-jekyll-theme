From wills and [trusts](/docs/what-is-a-trust/) to life insurance policies, guardianship and power of attorney, there are a number of [estate planning](/docs/what-is-estate-planning/) tools available to help ensure your assets pass on to the right people in the event of your death or disability. Here are a few key components to consider when deciding how to distribute and manage finances, property and more.

## Will and Trust in an Estate Plan

Both [wills and trusts](/docs/difference-between-wills-trusts/) ensure that your assets go to the heirs you choose. In some cases, creating a trust may cut down on your estate's tax payments. If you die without a will or a trust, your estate is subject to your state's inheritance laws.

## Beneficiaries

Many people have assets that pass to specific people whether there is a will or not. Examples are life insurance and 401(k) plans. You should choose a beneficiary (and a backup) through your plan. Select beneficiaries who are 21 or older and mentally capable. Otherwise, your decision could be contested.

## Guardianships

[Wills](/docs/what-is-a-will/) often name the guardians and backup guardians for minor children. If your will does not, a separate portion of your estate plan should. Without a guardianship designation, your children could go to relatives you would not have chosen or even go into foster care.

## Durable Power of Attorney

Those facing mental or physical disability that may affect financial and legal decision-making may designate a trusted individual to act on their behalf using durable power of attorney. While people often choose a spouse, you are free to choose your own agent to make legal decisions, conduct financial transactions and take care of real estate matters. This person should be financially smart and understand your wishes and best interests.

## Health Care Power of Attorney

Health care issues are separate from the matters covered under power of attorney. However, you can appoint the same person for both. Under the health care power of attorney, your agent makes your medical decisions if you are unable to. Choose someone who knows your wishes and who will follow them. Be sure to name a backup as well.
