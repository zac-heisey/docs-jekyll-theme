Chances are, you do need [estate planning](/docs/what-is-estate-planning/). It's a smart way to protect your loved ones and assets while potentially avoiding probate. Estate plans may also reduce taxes and help keep families intact.

## Protect Your Loved Ones

Estate plans can protect your loved ones in two main ways. First, if you have minor children or adult children with severe disabilities, an estate plan allows you to appoint a guardian or conservator to oversee their living situation and finances. Second, you may have adult beneficiaries who tend to make bad decisions. An estate plan protects them and your assets. It shields your estate from creditors, your beneficiaries' exes (in the case of a separation or pending divorce), and various outside influences.

## Protect Your Assets

Your assets could disappear quickly if you don't take preparations. Fortunately, an estate plan helps to ensure your assets are treated the way you want them to be. In addition to trusts or wills to protect your spouse, children or other beneficiaries, pre- or post-nuptial agreements may help to provide for children from a previous relationship.

## Create a Smoother Experience

You may have witnessed devastating estate fights among your friends and family members. These arguments often tear families apart and turn out costly for the estate. [An estate plan](/docs/what-is-included-in-an-estate-plan/) minimizes or eliminates the chance of painful conflict.

## [Cut Down on Estate Taxes](/docs/how-do-i-decrease-estate-inheritance-taxes/)

State and federal taxes take a big bite out of many people's estates. That money could otherwise have gone to heirs, and proper planning may reduce the overall amount of tax your estate pays.

## Avoid Probate

Probate can be costly and time-consuming, and during the process information about your estate becomes public record. In addition, the law does not allow your personal representatives much discretion as to what they are allowed to do for the estate. Proper estate planning may mean avoiding probate altogether.
