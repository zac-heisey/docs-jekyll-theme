The federal government and some states levy taxes whenever someone transfers property to another. If this transfer occurs while the giver is alive, it is a gift tax; if it happens upon death, it is an estate tax. The amount of this tax applies to the value of the gross estate before any deductions. [Estate taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-tax) are levied only on estates valued at $11.4 million or higher in 2019, an amount that can change yearly.

## What Is Included in the Gross Estate?

Those subject to the estate tax must file a federal estate tax return on the gross value. Property that counts toward this value includes the following:

* Real estate
* Stocks and bonds
* Mortgages
* Notes and cash
* Life insurance (on the decedent)
* Property jointly owned with a spouse

For spouses who own property together, only one-half of anything held jointly counts toward the gross estate.

## What Are Estate Tax Exemptions?

There are two exemptions to estate taxes: a personal exemption, and the marital deduction. The personal exemption is the $11.4 million mentioned previously. That amount is tax-free, while anything above that amount is subject to tax. The marital deduction allows one’s estate to transfer to the surviving spouse tax-free, provided he or she is a citizen of the U.S. and assets pass directly to him or her. So, in cases where one partner dies with an estate worth $30 and wills half to a spouse and half to a child, the spouse’s half is not taxed. For the child’s half ($15 million), only the amount above the personal exemption is taxed, i.e. $3.6 million.

Just six states impose an inheritance tax, while the federal government does not. Pennsylvania, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, Iowa and Kentucky have inheritance taxes that apply in addition to the federal estate tax. These states all waive this tax for spouses.
