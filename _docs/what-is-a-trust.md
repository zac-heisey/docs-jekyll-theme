When you think of a trust, you may immediately think of "trust fund babies" and the ultra-rich. However, this type of legal financial document is used by people of all socioeconomic classes, not just the wealthy. While wills may be a more common document, a trust is not the same thing. Therefore, it is important for you to fully understand what a trust is if you are beginning your [estate planning](/docs/what-is-estate-planning/) and are looking into potential ways to arrange your assets.

## The Basics of a Trust

In addition to basic [wills](/docs/what-is-a-will/), more and more people are beginning to use a different form of estate planning to divide their assets. A trust is a fiduciary contract that enables you to pass your assets on to a beneficiary. The trust is managed by a third party, or trustee, who ensures the beneficiary receives the correct assets according to the rules of the document. Trusts are a way to legally perform the following tasks:

* Divide your assets
* Protect your assets before and after death
* Avoid probate
* Minimize taxes
* Decide when beneficiaries can access your assets
* Reduce estate taxes

## Types of Trusts

There are several different kinds of trusts you can use depending on your needs. For some, the terms are irrevocable and cannot be changed after you create the trust. Others are considered a living trust and can be put into effect during your life and changed as you see fit. Common types of trusts include provisions for:

* Spouses
* Children
* Charitable giving
