People often believe that a will is the same thing as a trust. While wills are by far the more common of the two, both are legally binding contracts that can be created by anyone who wants to divide their assets. However, you should understand how they are different so you can choose the one that suits your needs.

## A Brief Explanation of a Will

First of all, [what is a will](/docs/what-is-a-will/)? In short, it is a legal fiduciary document that allows you to divvy up your assets once you have died. You can specify the items you want certain beneficiaries to have, including finances, personal property and other assets. The document can be amended at any point during your life and is only put into effect after your death. A will and itâ€™s inclusions are required to enter probate court, which means your beneficiaries must wait until that process is over before gaining possession of the assets included in the will.

## A Brief Explanation of a Trust

[Trusts]((/docs/what-is-a-trust/)), on the other hand, are a bit more complex. These documents also allow you to divide your assets among your beneficiaries. However, you have a few more options with a trust. For example, such a document may specifically benefit a spouse, child or charitable organization.

Another difference is that there are both revocable and irrevocable trusts. In the former case, you may amend the document whenever you wish. An irrevocable trust, however, enacts a permanent distribution of assets. Unlike a will, a trust may come into effect while you are still alive, if you wish. Many people choose this option to potentially avoid estate taxes, probate court and other financial issues.
