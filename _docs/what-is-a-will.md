A will is a legal document that details your wishes for your minor children and your assets in the event of your death. Wills can head off many potential issues, but in some cases it's a good idea to establish both a [will and trust](/docs/do-i-need-a-will-or-trust/).

## State Laws on Wills Vary

Each state has its laws on what makes a valid will. Follow these guidelines to ensure yours holds up to any challenges:

* Have witnesses watch you sign the will, and have them sign as well.
* Get the will notarized.
* Keep your will up-to-date by reviewing it every two years.
* Store your will in a secure place.
* Leave clear instructions for where the document can be found.
* Make a separate will from your spouse (most courts do not recognize joint wills).

## What Wills Cover and Do Not Cover

Wills do not cover plans such as life insurance and 401(k) because you name beneficiaries through these plans. Depending on your state and how much you leave your spouse, there may also be issues with assets you jointly owned. To avoid a challenge, an inheritance left to a spouse should generally meet state minimums, which are typically 30 to 50% of the total estate. Otherwise, items a will may cover include:

* Plans for most of your assets to be distributed.
* Financial legacies or guardianship designations for minor children.
* Directions for business succession.
* Designation of an executor for your estate.

## You Can Have Trusts with a Will

[Trusts](/docs/what-is-a-trust/) are a way to minimize taxes and to distribute your assets. They tend to deal with very specific assets, so you will likely still need a will for any remaining assets.

## Consider a Living Will

A living will spells out your wishes in the case of certain serious medical situations. It may cover areas such as resuscitation and life support. It is not part of a traditional will, but it's important and can be an addendum to your will. For more on wills and other estate planning issues, [check out our blog](/blog/).
