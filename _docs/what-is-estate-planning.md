In estate planning, you provide for your loved ones and plan the distribution of your assets in case of your death or disability. While [creating a will](/docs/what-is-a-will/) is important for anyone with even modest money or property, many individuals do not realize how essential it is to make a clear legal plan for dividing and dispensing assets.

## Everyone Should Consider Estate Planning

There's a stereotype that estate planning is for senior citizens only. In reality, everyone should have an estate plan. For example, younger parents need to name guardians for their minor children, and people on their second or third marriages may want to ensure that their current spouse as well as their children from previous relationships are provided for.

It is important to note that families with modest assets are often the [ones who most need estate planning](/docs/do-i-need-an-estate-plan/). Without a clearly defined document, a family could lose everything. Fortunately, the process does not have to be expensive, and for many families, a will alone suffices.

## The Alternative Is State Law

Without a will or estate plan, state law determines what happens to your estate. Your children and your assets could end up with people you never intended for them to.

## Plan for Your Loved Ones and Your Assets

[Estate plans can include](/docs/what-is-included-in-an-estate-plan/) directives for the following:

* Beneficiaries of life insurance policies or 401(k) plans
* Guardians and financial managers for minor children
* Instructions for your care in case of a disability
* Power of attorney 
* Health care directives
* Trusts
* Business succession
* Statements about values you want to pass on (work ethic, religion, etc.)

## Start Planning Your Estate Today

Many people wait to make plans for their estate because they don't fully recognize its importance. The time to prepare is now, before your family potentially loses valuable assets or is torn apart by infighting over what you would have wanted.
