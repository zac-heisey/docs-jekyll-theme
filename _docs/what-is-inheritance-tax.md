If you have been named as a beneficiary in a loved oneâ€™s estate, it would seem like good news to learn that you are receiving an inheritance. Of course, this is a positive event, but it can be followed by a caveat that complicates things. More often than not, an inheritance is subject to an inheritance tax, which can come as an unpleasant surprise. The amount of this tax varies, and it is the beneficiary of the estate, rather than the estate itself, who is responsible for its payment. There are a few things you should know about these taxes if you have received or will be receiving an inheritance in the near future.  
  
## How Inheritance Tax Is Determined
  
Inheritance taxes are not assessed at the federal level. Instead, each state determines the criteria for the tax. Large estates are subject to federal taxes, but if you are receiving a relatively modest inheritance, you may only be subject to state-level taxation. Some of the factors that determine your tax rate include the following:

* Relationship to the decedent
* Total sum of inheritance
* Source of the inheritance

## How Much Inheritance Tax Will I Pay?
  
There is no single formula to determine the exact rate your inheritance may be taxed at. Typically, though, tax rates start at under 10 percent and may be as high as 19 percent. Where you land in this spectrum is determined foremost by your relationship to the decedent. If you are a spouse or child, for example, you are less likely to be subject to a high tax rate. Additionally, the greater the amount of the inheritance, the higher your tax rate is likely to be. In most states, there is a minimum threshold that the sum must meet in order to be subject to tax on inheritance.
