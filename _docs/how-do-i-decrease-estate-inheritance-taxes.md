You've worked hard for years to build your asset portfolio and you don't want to give the government any more of it than necessary. Even after you're gone, you want your family to be able to enjoy what you leave behind for them. Here are some ways to potentially decrease estate taxes, which are also known as inheritance taxes.
What Is the Estate Tax?
Estate taxes are often confused with probate expenses. You may be able to avoid probate costs by setting up a trust, but that is not the case with estate taxes. Federal inheritance taxes can consume up to 55% of your estate, and they are due in cash within nine months of your death. Paying those taxes often forces the sale of property to raise the money.
The amount of tax your estate owes is calculated by adding up the value of the assets you own minus any debt. Each year Congress sets an exemption amount for the federal estate tax. If your estate's value exceeds the exemption amount, taxes are assessed. However, with proper planning, you can reduce or avoid estate taxes entirely.
What Are Some Ways to Avoid Estate Taxes?
Here are three tips that may be able to help you avoid or reduce inheritance taxes:
If you are married, each partner has an estate tax exemption. If the value of your estate is below the combined total of the exemptions, you can reduce or avoid the estate tax.
You can take assets out of your estate before you die. For example, you could donate to a favorite charity to reduce the value of the estate while helping out a cause you feel passionately about. 
You can purchase life insurance in an amount that would replace the assets you gave to the charity. You could also buy a life insurance policy large enough to cover the estate taxes.
