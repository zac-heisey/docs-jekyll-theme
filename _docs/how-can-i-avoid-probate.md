Having to deal with the [probate process](/docs/how-long-is-probate-process/) can be a time-consuming, frustrating, and expensive ordeal, especially for a family who is grieving the loss of a loved one. With effective [estate planning](/docs/what-is-estate-planning/), you can potentially avoid probate altogether while ensuring your wishes are honored after you pass. Of course, the easiest way to not have to deal with probate is by not owning any property, but for most people with assets, this is not a practical solution.

Instead, here are three more realistic approaches you can take to avoid probate court.

## 1. Beneficiary Designation

Just as you would name a beneficiary for a life insurance policy, you can name a beneficiary for some of your assets. Investment and bank accounts may be denoted as POD, or payable on death, and property can have deeds with a transfer on death designation, allowing these assets to pass onto your heir without being held 
up in legal limbo.

## 2. Revocable Living Trusts

This estate planning option is another possible way for you to leave your assets to your heirs without going through probate. With the help of a lawyer, you can establish this kind of [trust](/docs/what-is-a-trust/) while you are alive and make changes as needed. Be sure to be meticulous about which assets belong to your trust, otherwise this legal tool may not hold up in court if challenged.

## 3. Joint Ownership with Rights of Survivorship

Renaming investment accounts by just adding the name of your heir is not enough to protect it. Be sure that you set up your assets properly, whether you have bank accounts or real estate. Without the rights of survivorship designation, the surviving owner may have legal or probate complications.

Short of gifting your assets to your heirs while you're alive, you can protect what you've worked so hard for over a lifetime through estate planning.
